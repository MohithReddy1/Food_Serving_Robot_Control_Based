# Food Serving Robot
# Description 
This Project is basically Food Serving Robot. This is based on controlling using 433Mhz Wireless RF Transmitter Receiver Board with HT12D HT12E upto 150 mtr range. RF Module is  a small electronic device used to transmit and/or receive radio signals between two devices. After placing food on plate, we can control the robot in different directions        forward, backward, left turn, right turn using RF Transmitter Module controlling board towards the destination person or table. And place the RF Receiver Module in Circuit of robot. There is a head clockwise and anticlockwise rotation also if we place a camera on head, we can see the camera output we can control After serving Food we can return back the robot using RF Module Transmitter Board.
